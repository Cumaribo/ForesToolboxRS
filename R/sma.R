#' Spectral Mixture Analysis (SMA)
#'
#' The SMA assumes that the energy received, within the field of vision of the
#' remote sensor, can be considered as the sum of the energies received from each
#' dominant endmember. This function addresses a Linear Mixing Model.

#' @section Note:
#' A regression analysis is used to obtain the fractions. In least squares
#' inversion algorithms, the common objective is to estimate abundances that
#' minimize the squared error between the actual spectrum and the estimated spectrum.
#' The values of the fractions will be between 0 and 1.
#' @param img Optical images. It could be RasterStack or RasterBrick.
#' @param endm Endmembers must be a matrix or data.frame and with more than one edmember.
#' Rows represent the endmembers and columns represent the spectral bands.  The number
#' of bands must be greater than the number of endmembers.
