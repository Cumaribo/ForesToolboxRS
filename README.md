# ForesToolboxRS
The PVts-β approach is implemented in R with the ForesToolboxRS package. This algorithm will allow to detect disturbances in the 
forests using all the available Landsat set. In fact, it can also be run with sensors such as MODIS (Moderate Resolution 
Imaging Spectroradiometer). In essence, the PVts-β approach is an algorithm that does not model the seasonal component 
in time series, instead it only requires calculating the mean and standard deviation of the time series itself to detect 
disturbances. Therefore, the PVts-β approach is a method: i) simple and intelligent that does not model seasonality, ii) 
has only one calibration parameter and iii) can be easily implemented by any standard user.
